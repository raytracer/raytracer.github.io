Hi, I'm a computer scientist from Germany. I have been interested in Software Engineering and Web Development for over a decade now. Thats why I chose to major in Computer Science and received a B.Sc. and M.Sc. from the University of W端rzburg in the years 2013 and 2016. Currently I am a Software Engineer and Executive Director of [Olyro](https://olyro.de/). We develop Knowledge-based systems and Mobile Solutions for law firms, medical companies, universities and other companies. Use the various listed social media outlets if you want to get in touch with me.

My main areas of interest are programming languages and paradigms, Computer Graphics (especially offline rendering) and Software Engineering (with a focus on Performance Engineering). See my paper on a [QPN to LQN transformation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157106611630069X) published in the Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science for more details on my work. I'm interested in the full technology stack starting with hardware description languages and assembler on the low end and web development and model transformations on the upper end.

    ### SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

    The development of software in various areas from system programming to web
    development is my area of expertise. In the last years I concentrated my
    effort on web development on the front and back end.  I'm interested in
    modern design patterns and development methodologies. I also had the
    opportunity to gather first hand experience with Scrum. My primary languages
    are: JavaScript, Python, Java, Scala, Clojure and C++.  Furthermore I have
    been working with C#, Go, Dart and the shader languages HLSL and GLSL.

    ### COMPUTER GRAPHICS 
    
    Tough performance requirements are challenges I have always been interested
    in. From inline assembler and C++ intrinsics all the way up to advanced
    statistics and queuing theory. I have gathered the necessary tools to
    optimize modern software systems in a variety of different areas.

    ### PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING 
    
    Computer Graphics is a subject close to my heart. In the early years I
    focused on real-time rendering using DirectX and OpenGL. I later moved to
    offline rendering and 3D modeling. I'm interested in the content creation
    (using tools like Blender, ZBrush and Houdini Side Effects) as well as the
    technical aspects of rendering (ray/path tracing, MLT etc.)
