<p>Hi, I’m a computer scientist from Germany. I have been interested in
Software Engineering and Web Development for over a decade now. Thats
why I chose to major in Computer Science and received a B.Sc. and M.Sc.
from the University of Würzburg in the years 2013 and 2016. Currently I
am a Software Engineer and Executive Director of <a
href="https://olyro.de/">Olyro</a>. We develop Knowledge-based systems
and Mobile Solutions for law firms, medical companies, universities and
other companies. Use the various listed social media outlets if you want
to get in touch with me.</p>
<p>My main areas of interest are programming languages and paradigms,
Computer Graphics (especially offline rendering) and Software
Engineering (with a focus on Performance Engineering). See my paper on a
<a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157106611630069X">QPN
to LQN transformation</a> published in the Electronic Notes in
Theoretical Computer Science for more details on my work. I’m interested
in the full technology stack starting with hardware description
languages and assembler on the low end and web development and model
transformations on the upper end.</p>

<h3 id="software-engineering">SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h3>
The development of software in various areas from system programming to
web development is my area of expertise. In the last years I
concentrated my effort on web development on the front and back end. I’m
interested in modern design patterns and development methodologies. I
also had the opportunity to gather first hand experience with Scrum. My
primary languages are: JavaScript, Python, Java, Scala, Clojure and C++.
Furthermore I have been working with C#, Go, Dart and the shader
languages HLSL and GLSL.

<h3 id="computer-graphics">COMPUTER GRAPHICS</h3>
Tough performance requirements are challenges I have always been
interested in. From inline assembler and C++ intrinsics all the way up
to advanced statistics and queuing theory. I have gathered the necessary
tools to optimize modern software systems in a variety of different
areas.

<h3 id="performance-engineering">PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING</h3>
Computer Graphics is a subject close to my heart. In the early years I
focused on real-time rendering using DirectX and OpenGL. I later moved
to offline rendering and 3D modeling. I’m interested in the content
creation (using tools like Blender, ZBrush and Houdini Side Effects) as
well as the technical aspects of rendering (ray/path tracing, MLT etc.)

CryptoGraph is an experimental social network that is able to deliver
messages using an end-to-end encryption. It is web based and supports
multiple devices of every user at the same time.

Mailingful was an email service in the spirit of Google Inbox but with a
focus on performance and minimality. See the git repo for more
information.

UniWueMensa is an Android Application that displays the latest cafeteria
menu from the University of Wuerzburg as a swipeable list. Furthermore
it reads the remaining credit on the student ID via NFC.
