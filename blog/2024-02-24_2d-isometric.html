<p>Recently I have gotten back into using Go as my main development
language. Since I also wanted to experiment with game development I went
to look for game engines in Go. I wanted to focus on 2d game engines and
found <a href="https://ebitengine.org/">ebitengine</a>. It has a simple
to use API and offers great examples. I especially like that the same
image type can be used to draw from and to an image. So drawing to the
screen from a sprite involves only a single type. Nice!</p>
<p>The game experiment I wanted to conduct was to build a 2.5D isometric
game. The basic Tile has a dimension of 32 x 16 Pixels. Drawing a 2.5D
isometric scene requires solving a difficult problem. How to determine
the drawing order of the scene? This is quite hard and not obvious at
all. <a href="https://shaunlebron.github.io/IsometricBlocks/">Here</a>
is a great explanation of this problem and a solution. It consists of
two basic steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a dependency graph. What objects has to be drawn before what
other object? In my game this will be simplified since I do not consider
height in any way.</li>
<li>Use a topologic sort algorithm to create a list from the dependency
graph. Be careful though this can fail if there is a cycle present!</li>
</ol>
<p>This took me a while to build as I did not need a 3d version. Here is
a small visual explanation of my solution:</p>

<p>I basically trace 4 rays for every outer corner of every pair of
rectangles. If the ray does not only hit the corner but the other
rectangle as well, decide if the intersection point is closer to the
camera. If it is it needs to be drawn after the other rectangle. For the
topologic sort algorithm I used the <a
href="https://github.com/philopon/go-toposort">go-toposort</a>
library.</p>
<p>To conclude the experiment I included the <a
href="https://github.com/solarlune/resolv">resolv</a> library to perform
basic collision checks. The finished experiment includes a placeholder
for the player that can shoot a “fireball” projectile and a set of
columns on a basic level grass like surface.</p>

<p>Maybe I will continue to further develop this prototype in the future
