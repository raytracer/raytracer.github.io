<main>
<p>I have been working with so called fantasy consoles for about 4
years. I have already written about my experience using wasm4 <a
href="./2022-10-23_game_development_with_wasm4.html">here</a>. Fantasy
console are basically programming/execution environments with a set of
usually quite restrictive constraints (e.g. limited resolution, input
methods, memory etc.). These really help with creativity and producing
an actual result, instead of bike shedding and never actually producing
anything.</p>
<h2 id="wasm-4">WASM-4</h2>
<p>My favorite platform up until last year was WASM-4. It allows you to
use compiled languages (as long as they target wasm) and has even basic
online multiplayer support. Unfortunately support for the Go version has
been quite bad in recent releases. They have been relying on tinygo, but
problems with memory management are still present. Maybe with upcoming
wasm support from go itself these problems will go away (though I would
be worried about the resulting cart size), but for now they remain.</p>
<p>It also has no inbuilt tooling like a text editor, sprite editor or
sound editor (though there are third party carts for the <a
href="https://wasm4.org/play/iwas">latter</a>). That means you can use
your already existing favorite tooling, but it also means it is less
integrated workflow than e.g. Pico8.</p>
<p>Being limited to 4 colors is also quite restrictive and makes the
import of sprites a bit tedious (they are basically converted into byte
arrays of the host language). Since one color is used for transparency
you are limited to 3 colors per sprite. That is just not enough for a
lot of games.</p>
<p>My last game for WASM-4 was an <a
href="https://github.com/raytracer/wasm4-islands">Anno 1602 demake</a>
which used pushed the limits of the WASM-4 color “space”. But working
around the memory problems and restriction (64kb) was a bit tedious and
was costing motivation. I didn’t really added any music, but that basic
game play loop was close to finished.</p>

<h2 id="generative-ai">Generative AI</h2>
<p>For this last game I was also using generative AI for the first time
(on the topic of game development that is). On two fronts the use was
quite successful.</p>
<h3 id="sprite-creation">Sprite Creation</h3>
<p>All sprites in the game are AI generated (with the exception of the
resources in the header). They are generated with a <a
href="https://civitai.com/models/195730/aziibpixelmix">SD 1.5 base model
tuned for pixel art</a>. The result gets down sampled 8 times and color
corrected via a <a
href="https://github.com/mrreplicart/sd-webui-pixelart">web ui
extension</a>. I used txt2img and img2img for most attempts. Most
sprites needed about 50-100 generated images until I got something
usable. The result was converted into a 4 color indexed png using my own
little <a
href="https://github.com/raytracer/closest-png-index">tool</a>. Finally
I did some cleaning up in aseprite.</p>
<h3 id="island-generation">Island Generation</h3>
<p>I was looking for an algorithm to create islands and I used deepseek
and chatgpt. Deepseek produced a nice looking well commented algorithm
that ultimately did not really produce a useful output. Chatgpt (o1) on
the other hand produced a great result even though the code itself did
not look to appealing. I changed the result to use a memory conserving
bitset. See the result in the linked repository. These are both one shot
results so quite impressive I would say.</p>
<h2 id="pico8-and-picotron">Pico8 and Picotron</h2>
<p>The future of my endeavour in game development will probably take
place in Pico8 and <a
href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php">Picotron</a>. While Pico8
was a pioneer in the fantasy console world and has a great community,
Picotron on the other hand is more of a workstation with some softened
restraints to create bigger games with even better integrated
tooling.</p>
<p>I will stick with Go as my main programming language for bigger games
(probably using ebitengine as my favorite engine).</p>
<p>I may return to WASM-4 once they fixed their go implementation, but
not for now.</p>
