<p>I have to admit that I was very skeptical when I first heard of <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a>. The claims just sounded overblown. Sure the performance is great, but what about the feature set? If it does non of the things that <em>webpack</em> does of course it would be faster.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. The feature gap for most common use cases was closed quickly. Watching for file system changes for instance has been implemented for quite a while now. Features like tree shaking, different loaders, jsx/tsx support and source maps are integrated. The only real feature that I am missing is incremental type checking (since type checking is out of scope for this project it will probably not be added), but this is mostly handled by my IDE (or a git pre-commit hook to prevent nonsense being commited to the git server).</p>
<p><em>esbuild</em> will of course never replace webpack with all of its possibilities and countless plugins. But for most projects I don’t need this flexibility. I would rather not have to worry about having a webpack plugin or yet another external dependency break after a few years. Furthermore while <em>esbuild</em> provides an API (accessible from both go and js) I use it exclusively via its cli tool. No more <code>webpack.config.js</code>. Now while this might not work for large organically grown projects, for most of my smaller projects it works flawlessly however. High performance and a decent and accessible feature set. Thank you <em>esbuild</em>!</p>
