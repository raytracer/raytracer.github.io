<p>A long standing dream of humanity is probably to create applications
without the need to learn a programming language. This manifests itself
in millions of excel sheets that are probably running a lot more
important processes in quite a few companies than one might guess. Now
while Excel is very accessible for ordinary users and makes it easy to
create simple formulas and even complex programs through VBA it usually
falls flat when the need to scale arises.</p>
<p>Here no/low code solutions come into play by restricting the user
input through column types, but at the same time offering a rich UI to
configure these restrictions and constraints. This makes it possible for
the computer to help the user, because it has a better understanding of
what is going on. This idea is of course not new. Microsoft Access has
provided a solution for decades now, but it was never really polished
and never got anywhere near the momentum of Excel.</p>
<p>New SaaS solutions like <a
href="https://www.airtable.com/">Airtable</a>, <a
href="https://seatable.io/">Seatable</a>, <a
href="https://baserow.io/">Baserow</a> or <a
href="https://www.nocodb.com/">NocoDB</a> want to change that. All of
them have a very similar approach. NocoDB is notably different, since it
can even work with existing databases (multiple database types like
Sqlite, MariaDB and PostgreSQL are supported). It is quite new and the
interface is not really polished yet. The other solution have a lot in
common. If you understand one of them, you are not going to have any
problems switching (save for one or two features maybe).</p>
<p>I will choose Seatable for my future examples. It is from Germany (as
am I) and it can be self hosted (just like all of them except
Airtable).</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-simple-invoicing-system">Creating a simple Invoicing
System</h3>
<p>A lot of examples and templates of these products are of course
directed at the general public and beginners (I mean a wedding planner
as a prime example for a No-Code solution, really?). But as a Computer
Scientist I am more interested in real business processes and how they
can be mapped these products. Let’s start with a simple example. Say we
want to create invoices, render them to PDF and send them out to
clients. Additionally we want to create some basic statistics to
visualize our cashflow. Let’s see what the strength and weaknesses of
these solutions are.</p>
<p>We will create 3 tables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invoices - Including our final PDFs</li>
<li>Position - The individual positions of an invoice</li>
<li>Customers - Basic information to print on the invoice</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s start with the customer table, since it does not depend on
other tables. We create a new base (let’s name it “Simple Invoices”) and
rename the existing table to “Customers”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./2022-08-15_exploring_no_low-code_solutions/customers.png"
alt="Customers Table" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Customers Table</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see we just list the number, name and the address here
(they are all text fields except for the first column, it has the
<code>auto number</code> type). The column on the left is the primary
column. It is similar but not the same as the primary key of a database.
It supports less types than the other columns. Currently one of the
biggest difference between Airtable and Seatable here is the support of
formulas in the primary column.</p>
<p>Let’s continue with the invoices table. Create a new table by
clicking the plus icon and name it “Invoices”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./2022-08-15_exploring_no_low-code_solutions/invoices.png"
alt="Invoices" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Invoices</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Their are 6 columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>We create a auto number column for the invoice number it uses the
current year as a prefix</li>
<li>We create a reference / link column to the “Customers” table to
reference the customer (remember to remove the checkbox for allowing
multiple customers when creating this column, see picture below)</li>
<li>The next column is the date of the invoice, we could use a
<code>created</code> type column here if we usually send out invoices
the same day it was created</li>
<li>We define a global tax rate that applies to all positions (a
simplification, but depending on the business it might just be
enough)</li>
<li>A short description with a default value that tells the customer to
not forget to mention the invoice number in the bank transfer (can be
changed)</li>
<li>The last column is a <code>file</code> column, it stores the final
PDF</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img
src="./2022-08-15_exploring_no_low-code_solutions/customer-link.png"
width="250" alt="Link Customer" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Link Customer</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Before we can define the button and the invoice layout we must first
create our final table, the positions table.</p>
<p>Create a table called “Postions”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./2022-08-15_exploring_no_low-code_solutions/positions.png"
alt="Invoices" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Invoices</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This table has 7 columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a auto number primary column (not strictly necessary)</li>
<li>A reference / link to a single invoice (remember to remove the
checkbox for allowing multiple invoices when creating this column)</li>
<li>A short description of the item</li>
<li>A net price without tax (a <code>number</code> /
<code>currency</code>)</li>
<li>An amount (a <code>number</code> )</li>
<li>A type (we use a single choice here)</li>
<li>The combined net price as a <code>formula</code> (see picture below
for details)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img
src="./2022-08-15_exploring_no_low-code_solutions/combined-net-price.png"
width="250" alt="Combined Net Price" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Combined Net Price</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once we are done with that we can go back to the invoices table and
create two new columns. One for adding all the positions and one for
multiplying the result with our tax rate. You can also see that the new
“Positions” column appeared all by itself when we referenced the invoice
in the “Positions” table.</p>
<figure>
<img
src="./2022-08-15_exploring_no_low-code_solutions/net-price-invoice.png"
width="250" alt="Combined Net Price" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Combined Net Price</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img
src="./2022-08-15_exploring_no_low-code_solutions/price-with-tax.png"
width="250" alt="Price With Tax" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Price With Tax</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And that is it! The only thing left is creating a PDF from our table.
This is done by enabling the “Page Designer” plugin (see the right
corner) and designing a new template. My example can be seen below. It
is pretty self explanatory. Just drag and drop the desired fields into
the template.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./2022-08-15_exploring_no_low-code_solutions/template.png"
alt="PDF Template" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">PDF Template</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally create a new column “Action” in the “Invoices” table to
generate PDFs, by choosing the <code>button</code> type and and
selecting generate PDF as an option.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./2022-08-15_exploring_no_low-code_solutions/pdf-button.jpeg"
width="250" alt="Generation Button" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Generation Button</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That is it, we are done here!</p>
<h4 id="downsides">Downsides</h4>
<p>There are a couple of downsides especially when it comes to nesting.
Tables can reference other tables, but a table like “Positions” really
only makes sense in combination with an invoice. You can introduce
groups in a view and that helps a lot, but still “Positions” should
probably be embedded into “Invoices”. This becomes more apparent when we
want to create forms. Forms cannot yet create nested elements on the
fly, so you would have to call multiple forms in succession. This is not
really practical yet.</p>
<h3 id="going-a-different-route-for-developers-only">Going a different
route (for developers only)</h3>
<p>For developers there are of course other options. One would be to use
a code generator like <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a>.
JHipster uses a domain modeling language to generate backend + frontend
+ database. I like the tech stack a lot, but the problem I see is the
amount of friction in the beginning. You still have to generate
scaffolding and write the domain language file. Whereas in something
like Airtable you can start right away. JHipster is the much more
flexible approach of course, but in “real” individual development
projects I usually have the extra bit of time to do what JHipster does
manually. And part of <a
href="./2020-12-30_my_favorite_tech_stack.md">our workflow</a> is
actually already automated.</p>
<p>Another possibility I just heard of is <a
href="https://www.superblocks.com/">Superblocks</a>. It is more like
Lego for developers much more akin to something like Airtable. I like
the ideas of it. It also can be used to create Dashboards and Forms and
plays nicely with custom code. If a customer is willing to make some
compromises (sadly that is often not the case) he/she could save quite a
bit of money here and still get a decent product.</p>
