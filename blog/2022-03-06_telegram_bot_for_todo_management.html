<main>
<p>For the longest time I have looked for a solution to manage todos. I
have tried out a lot of different solutions from services like <a
href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> and <a
href="https://www.any.do/">Any.do</a> to low tech solutions like <a
href="http://todotxt.org/">Todo.txt</a>. Nothing really stuck for a long
time. I have a couple of requirements for a todo system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi Platform (at least on android, iOS and desktop/web)</li>
<li>Intuitive UI (it must be easy and low friction to create a new
todo)</li>
<li>Some kind of automatic management/organization/scheduling of
todos</li>
</ul>
<p>Thats basically it. I don’t really need tags or projects or file
upload or anything like that. For a long time Any.do was the closest
contender, but it always had some weird pricing with some kind of
perpetual 50% discount going on (<em>but it will end next week! yeah
this time for real!</em>). I also was not to fond of the web version the
UI could have used a bit more love. On the other hand the Any.do moment
feature and their new grocery list feature I quite liked. The Any.do
moment basically helps you to periodically review todos and sort them
into buckets (<strong>done</strong>, <strong>today</strong>,
<strong>tomorrow</strong>, <strong>later</strong>).</p>
<p>Since I was not really interested in purchasing the commercial
version of Any.do (I was afraid I was not going to stick with it and
wasting the yearly subscription) I went ahead and built my own minimal
solution based on a telegram bot written in Java using this excellent <a
href="https://github.com/pengrad/java-telegram-bot-api">library</a> by
pengrad. It fulfills my most important criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telegram is cross platform</li>
<li>It uses basic natural (german) language commands (e.g. “morgen”,
“heute”, “nächste Woche”)</li>
<li>If a task has no deadline yet it will be scheduled for the next day
at 10am</li>
</ul>
<p>I can describe my todo using natural language and keywords (german
only). This is robust to a certain degree. I can leave out the time or
date or only use a weekday. A task without any recognized keyword will
receive a deadline for the next day at 10am. If the deadline of a task
is met I get a reminder message from the bot and I can easily postpone
it or mark it as done. It does not work that well for lists (like
shopping lists), but it is great for one off tasks. So I only really
miss the grocery shopping list from Any.do.</p>

<p>You can find the bot <a
href="https://t.me/todo_task_reminder_bot">here</a>. There is no
guarantee that this bot will work forever. I included the source code in
a gist:</p>
